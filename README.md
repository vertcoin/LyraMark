Lyra2RE parameter benchmarking tool

## Introduction

LyraMark is a benchmarking tool for the Lyra2RE PoW (Proof of Work) algorithm used by the Vertcoin cryptocurrency. The primary reason for the tool to exist is to find new parameters for the algorithm whenever there is a good reason (ASICs, botnets, etc.) for a change.
